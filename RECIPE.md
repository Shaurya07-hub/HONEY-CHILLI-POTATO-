Step 1
To prepare this amazing Crispy Honey Chilli Potato, wash the potatoes and keep aside. 
Put a pressure cooker on medium flame and add the potatoes in them along with enough water.
Also, add a half a teaspoon salt. Pressure cook them for 1 whistle and let the steam release on its own.
The potatoes should be soft, but not squishy. Do not overcook the potatoes. Once the steam is released, drain the water and peel them in a large tray.
Cut them nicely in a long shape, just like French fries and keep aside until required.

Step 2 
Take a large bowl and mix together crushed garlic, red chillies, salt and cornflour. Use a little water to prepare the batter, and mix well.
Keep aside for 3 to 5 minutes. Now, add the potatoes and toss well so that the mixture completely coats the potatoes.

Step 3 
Now, put a wok over medium flame and heat oil in it. When the oil is hot enough, deep fry the potatoes till they are crispy. 
You can also double fry them if the required crispiness is not attained in one go.

Step 4 
Drain excess oil and place them on an absorbent paper. Now heat a little oil in a wok.
When the oil is hot enough, add 2 chopped garlic cloves, sesame seeds, vinegar and tomato chilli sauce along with the potatoes.
Cook for a minute and then turn off the heat. Pour honey, seasonings and onion shallots.
Toss well and sprinkle some sesame seeds and serve immediately. Leaving it for a while on the kitchen counter may take away its crunchiness.

TIPS-
To make restaurant-style honey chilli potatoes, cut the potato fingers evenly.
Make sure you use wok for cooking this dish as it gives enough scope for the sauces to properly coat the potatoes.
Deep fry the potato fingers for making them crispy.
Do not further cook the potatoes, if you have added honey to it.
